# FDA  Submission

**Masinde Mtesigwa Masinde**

**Name of your Device:**
MassCancello

## Algorithm Description 

### 1. General Information

**Intended Use Statement:** 
This algorithm is intended for use on assisting radiologist in detecting pneumonia for the patients who have been administered a screening chest x-ray
**Indications for Use:**
MassCancello is an image processing software that provides qualitative and quantitative analysis of the chest from x-ray
images to support clinicians in the evaluation and assessment of pneumonia disease. 

**Device Limitations:**
The results above indicate that the presence of infiltrations in a chest x-ray is a limitation of this algorithm, and that the algorithm performs very poorly on the accurate detection of pneumonia in the presence of infiltration. 

**Clinical Impact of Performance:**
The presence of nodules and pneumothorax have a some effects on the algorithm's sensitivity and which might reduce the ability to detect pneumonia, and the presence of effusion has a slight impact on specificity and may increase the number of false positive pneumonia classifications.

\label{fig:Process flowchart}
\end{figure}

**DICOM Checking Steps:**
The first step is pre-extract all data from DICOM headers into a dataframe
 - Body Part Examined
 - A patient age
 - A patient ID
 - Patient Sex (M/F)
 - DICOM Study number

**Preprocessing Steps:**

**CNN Architecture:**
The CNN algorithm which is used is VGG16

### 3. Algorithm Training

**Parameters:**
 
* Types of augmentation used during training
  - directory=None
  - x_col = 'path'
  - y_col = 'pneumonia_class'
  - class_mode = 'binary'
  - target_size =IMG_SIZE  
  - batch_size = 16 
  
* Batch size = 16 and 2000
* Optimizer learning rate =  Adam(lr=1e-4)
* Layers of pre-existing architecture that were frozen [0:-2]
* Layers of pre-existing architecture that were fine-tuned
* Layers added to pre-existing architecture

**Final Threshold and Explanation:**
With the threshold of 0.65 shows that the image has pneumonia with reference to figure 4
### 4. Databases
 
**Description of Training Dataset:** 
Data set have

Pneumonia cases: 1,430 
Non-Pneumonia cases: 110,674 

Our training set to be balanced between Pneumonia and Non-Pneumonia cases 
Our test set to reflect the real world proportions
To split our data between training and test sets in a 80% to 20% proportion

### 5. Ground Truth
The radiologists labeling.

### 6. FDA Validation Plan

**Patient Population Description for FDA Validation Dataset:**
The histograms shows that the age distribution that the patients are from age 5 to 95.
The gender histogram also shows that most patients are male.

**Description of Validation Dataset:** 

**Ground Truth Acquisition Methodology:**
The ground truth method
The silver standard approach of using several radiologists would be more optimal for  this algorithm.

**Algorithm Performance Standard:**
The algorithm does not perfom well this is because the accuracy is only 60%.
