    "The portal [https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/toolssoftware/ccs10/ccs10.jsp](https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/toolssoftware/ccs10/ccs10.jsp) presents an overview, description, technical guidance, and downloading Information for Clinical Classifications Software (CCS) for ICD-10-PCS (beta version). The CCS is developed as a part of Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP). We recommend you to go through each section to understand the data better. \n",

    "### Data Description\n",
    "We have already downloaded the `ccs_pr_icd10pcs_2020_1.zip` file available under the section \"Downloading Information for the CCS for ICD-10-PCS Tool\" in the above portal. We have tweaked the `.csv` file contained inside of the `.zip` file. The updated `.csv` file is provided locally in the current workspace, with the name `clean_ccs_pr_icd10pcs.csv`. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The `clean_ccs_pr_icd10pcs.csv` file is composed of the following eight fields separated by commas:\n",
    "1. Procedure Code as 'ICD-10-PCS CODE'\n",
    "1. 'CCS CATEGORY',\n",
    "1. 'ICD-10-PCS CODE DESCRIPTION',\n",
    "1. 'CCS CATEGORY DESCRIPTION',\n",
    "1. Multi-level 1 Category as 'MULTI CCS LVL 1',\n",
    "1. Multi-level 1 Category Description as 'MULTI CCS LVL 1 LABEL',\n",

    "1. Multi-level 2 Category Description as 'MULTI CCS LVL 2 LABEL'\n",

    "### Exercise\n",
    "1. If you search the CCS_CATEGORY_DESCRIPTION for \"coronary\", what are the two single level categories that you find? What is/are the label(s) for the multi-level 1 categories?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Given CCS single level category 45, what do you notice about the ICD10 PCS Codes? Do they all have a similar character pattern?\n",
