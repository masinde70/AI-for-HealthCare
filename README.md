### 2D medical Imaging 
- How it fits into medicine and the healthcare system.
- How to use AI to solve 2D Imaging problems 
- How to take AI from the bench to bedside to be used by doctors to improve patient lives

#### New terms
- **X-ray:** a 2D imaging technique that projects a type of radiation called x-rays down at the body from a single direction to capture a single image.
- Ultrasound: a 2D imaging technique that uses high-frequency sound waves to generate images.
- Computed Tomography (CT): a 3D imaging technique that emits x-rays from many different angles around the human body to capture more detail from more different angles.
- Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI): a 3D imaging technique that uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to create images of areas of the body from all different angles.
- 2D imaging: an imaging technique that pictures are taken from a single angle.
- 3D imaging: an imaging technique that pictures are taken from different angles to create a volume of images.

##### Medical Imaging Workflow
- Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS)
  * Every Imaging center and hospital have PACS. These systems allows for all medical imaging to be stored in the hospital's servers and transferred to different departments  throughout the hospital.
- Diagnostic Imaging 
  * In diagnostic situations, a clinitian orders an imaging study because they believe that a disease may be present based on the patient's symptoms. Diagnostic imaging can be performed in emergency settings as well as non-emergency settings.
    - Clinical believes something is wrong with the patient 
    - Need imaging to verify
    - e.g diagnosing brain tumor
- Screening
Screening studies are performed on populations of individuals who fall into risk groups for certain diseases. These tend to be diseases that are relatively common, have serious consequences, but also have the potential of being reversed if detected and treated early. For example, individuals who are above a certain age with a long smoking history are candidates for lung cancer screening which is performed using x-rays on an annual basis.
  * Nothing acutely wrong with the patient 
  * Patient in risk group for particular diseases
  * Imaging regularly for early detection
  * e.g regular screening for colonscopies because of family history.
 
 
 ### Application of Algorithms 
 * Track progression growth of tumour overtime -> Segmentation 
 * Identify the area of the lung where the fluid is -> Localization
 * Determine whether a tumor is malignant or benign -> Classification 
 
 ## key points
 * Model
 * Heuristic
 * Bernoul Distribution
 * Prior
 * Likelihood
 * Evidence
 * Posterior
 * Vocabulary 
 * Laplace Smoothing
 * Tokenization
 * Featurization
 * Lemmatization
 * Stemming 
 * Stop Word
 * Vectorizer
   Used in a step featurizing. It transforms some input into something else. One example is binary vectorizer which transforms tokenized messages into a binary vector indicating which items in the vocabulary appear in the message
 * Featurization
    The processin of transforming raw inputs into somethinga model can perform training and prediction on.
