#### New terms
- **X-ray:** a 2D imaging technique that projects a type of radiation called x-rays down at the body from a single direction to capture a single image.
- Ultrasound: a 2D imaging technique that uses high-frequency sound waves to generate images.
- Computed Tomography (CT): a 3D imaging technique that emits x-rays from many different angles around the human body to capture more detail from more different angles.
- Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI): a 3D imaging technique that uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to create images of areas of the body from all different angles.
- 2D imaging: an imaging technique that pictures are taken from a single angle.
- 3D imaging: an imaging technique that pictures are taken from different angles to create a volume of images.

##### Medical Imaging Workflow
- Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS)
  * Every Imaging center and hospital have PACS. These systems allows for all medical imaging to be stored in the hospital's servers and transferred to different departments  throughout the hospital.
- Diagnostic Imaging 
  * In diagnostic situations, a clinitian orders an imaging study because they believe that a disease may be present based on the patient's symptoms. Diagnostic imaging can be performed in emergency settings as well as non-emergency settings.
    - Clinical believes something is wrong with the patient 
    - Need imaging to verify
    - e.g diagnosing brain tumor
- Screening
Screening studies are performed on populations of individuals who fall into risk groups for certain diseases. These tend to be diseases that are relatively common, have serious consequences, but also have the potential of being reversed if detected and treated early. For example, individuals who are above a certain age with a long smoking history are candidates for lung cancer screening which is performed using x-rays on an annual basis.
  * Nothing acutely wrong with the patient 
  * Patient in risk group for particular diseases
  * Imaging regularly for early detection
  * e.g regular screening for colonscopies because of family history.

  ## Key stake holders
  
  #### Clinical Stakeholders
  Clinical stakeholders are radiologists, diagnosing clinicians and patients. Radiologists are likely the end-users of an AI application for 2D imaging. They care about low disruption to workflow and they play an important advisory role in the algorithm development process. Clinicians have less visibility into the inner workings of an algorithm. They also care about low disruption to workflows and they care about the interpretability of algorithm output.
  
  #### Industry Stakeholders
  Industry stakeholders include medical device companies, software companies, and hospitals. Many medical device companies typically have accompanying imaging software
  
  #### Regulatory Stakeholders
  
  The main regulatory stakeholder in the medical imaging world is the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA treats AI algorithms as medical devices. Medical devices are broken down into three classes by the FDA, Class I, Class II, and Class III, based on their potential risks present to the patient. A device's class dictates the safety controls, which in turn dictates which regulatory pathway they must go down. The two main regulatory pathways for medical devices are 510(k) and Pre-market Approval (PMA). Lower risk devices (Classes I & II) usually take a 501(k) submission pathway. Higher risk devices and algorithms (Class III) must go through PMA.
  
  
  ## Note!
  The patient is always a stakeholder when we are developing algorithms to read clinical imaging studies.

This tool will presumably help a radiologist to more accurately define the boundaries of a nodule and how they change over time, meaning it will part of the radiologist's workflow and therefore they are a stakeholder.

The software developer who creates this algorithm will be a key stakeholder as they will be responsible for describing the algorithm to the FDA.

The hospital will likely be the purchaser of your algorithm, and they are a key stakeholder in that the algorithm must be beneficial to them financially in order to be adopted into their radiology practice.

### Medical Image Exploratory Data Analysis
#### DICOM
DICOM "Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine", which is the standard for the communication and management of medical imaging information and related data.
* DICOM ensures the "interoperability" of medical imaging systems by making it easier to perform the following actions on medical images:
  * Produce, Store, Display, Send, Query, Process, Retrieve, Print
* By using DICOM, one can get derived structured documents and manage the related workflow more conveniently.
* DICOM files are a medical imaging file that is in the format that conforms to the DICOM standard.
* A DICOM file contains information about the imaging acquisition method, the actual medical images, and patient information. It has a header component that contains information about the acquired image and an image component that is a set of pixel data representing the actual images
* Protected Health Information (PHI) is part of DICOM and clinical data and radiologist report are not part of DICOM
* DICOM studies and series
With 2D imaging, a single 2D image is known as a single DICOM series. All image series combined comprise a study of the patient, known as a DICOM study.


For efficient algorithm training, the best practice is to pre-extract all data from DICOM headers into a dataframe.

DICOM header has some other applications besides training models. It can be used to mitigate the risks of the algorithm. It can also be used to optimize image processing workflow.

### **Summary**
    Some metadata may come from the DICOM headers, patient history, and image labels. Once we have all of a dataset's metadata stored in a single place, we'll then want to explore data features.

#### **Histograms**
    Histograms help us look at distributions of single variables. Sometimes we only want to look at distributions within a single class of our data.

#### **Scatterplots**
     Scatterplots are useful for assessing relationships between two variables.

#### **Pearson Correlation Coefficient**
    Pearson Correlation Coefficient measures how two variables are linearly related. The value ranges from -1 to 1. A value of 1 or -1 means the two variables are perfectly linearly related. A value of 0 implies there is no linear relationship between the two variables.

####  **Co-Occurrence Matrices**
    Co-Occurrence Matrices are useful for assessing how frequently different classifications co-occur together.

Not all 2D medical images are stored as a DICOM. Microscopy images are not stored in DICOM since they do not come from a digital machine. Instead, they are biological data and come from smeared physical cells from patients.

The first step of transforming microscopy into a digital image is to get the cell sample from a patient. Then cells are dyed into different colors based on their structure and viewed by a microscope. The microscopy data is then captured by a camera to form a digital image. This transformation technique is called digital pathology.

Once images are digitized, they can be processed with ML in the same way as you would with the pixel data extracted from DICOM.

    the distribution of all pixels' intensity values that comprise an image
### PHI:
   any individually identifiable health information, including demographic data, insurance information, and other information used to identify a patient
    
### ML vs. DL
The biggest difference between ML and DL is the concept of feature selection. Classical machine learning algorithms require predefined features in images. And, it takes up a lot of time and effort to design features. When deep learning came along, it was so groundbreaking because it worked to discover important features, taking this burden off of the algorithm researchers.

### Ostu's method
It’s often used for background extraction and classification. It takes the intensity distribution of an image and searches it to find the intensity threshold that minimizes the variance in each of the two classes. Once it discovers that threshold, it considers every pixel on one side of that image to be one class and on the other side to be another class.

### Convolutional neural network (CNN)
There are several sets of convolutional layers in a CNN model. Each layer is made up of a set of filters that are looking for features. Layers that come early in a CNN model look for very simple features such as directional lines and layers that come later look for complex features such as shapes.

Note that the input image size must match the size of the first set of convolutional layers.

### U-Net
U-Net is used for segmentation problems and it is more commonly used in 3D medical imaging. It's important to note that a limitation of 2D imaging is the inability to measure the volume of structures. 2D medical imaging only measures the area with respect to the angle of the image taken, which limits its utility in segmenting the whole area.


## Gold standard
The gold standard for a particular type of data refers to the method that detects disease with the highest sensitivity and accuracy. Any new method that is developed can be compared to this to determine its performance. The gold standard is different for different diseases.

## Ground truth
Often times, the gold standard is unattainable for an algorithm developer. So, you still need to establish the ground truth to compare your algorithm.

Ground truths can be created in many different ways. Typical sources of ground truth are

### Biopsy-based labeling. 
* Limitations: 
  difficult and expensive to obtain.
### NLP extraction. 
* Limitations: 
   may not be accurate.
### Expert (radiologist) labeling. 
* Limitations: 
  expensive and requires a lot of time to come up with labeling protocols.
### Labeling by another state-of-the-art algorithm. 
 * Limitations:
    may not be accurate.
## Silver standard
The silver standard involves hiring several radiologists to each make their own diagnosis of an image. The final diagnosis is then determined by a voting system across all of the radiologists’ labels for each image. Note, sometimes radiologists’ experience levels are taken into account and votes are weighted by years of experience.

## Intensity normalization
Intensity normalization is good practice and should always be done prior to using data for training. Making all of your intensity values fall within a small range that is close to zero helps the weights on our convolutional filters stay under control

## There are two types of normalization that you can perform.

* zero-meaning: subtract that mean intensity value from every pixel.
* standardization: subtract the mean from each pixel and divide by the image’s standard deviation.

### Image augmentation
Image augmentation allows us to create different versions of the original data. Keras provides ImageDataGenerator package for image augmentation.

## Note: 
not all image augmentation method is appropriate for medical imaging. A vertical flip should never be applied. And validation data should NEVER be augmented.

## Image resize
CNNs have an input layer that specifies the size of the image they can process. Keras flow_from_directory have a target_size parameter to resize image.

## Image Pre-processing

## GOALS:
* Remove potential noise from your images(e.g background extraction)
* Enforce some normalization across images(Zero-mean, standardization)
* Enlarge your dataset(Image Augmentation)
* Resize for your CNN architecture's required input

## Keras Image generator

ImageDataGenerator(rescale = 1. / 255)
