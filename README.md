#### New terms
- **X-ray:** a 2D imaging technique that projects a type of radiation called x-rays down at the body from a single direction to capture a single image.
- Ultrasound: a 2D imaging technique that uses high-frequency sound waves to generate images.
- Computed Tomography (CT): a 3D imaging technique that emits x-rays from many different angles around the human body to capture more detail from more different angles.
- Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI): a 3D imaging technique that uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to create images of areas of the body from all different angles.
- 2D imaging: an imaging technique that pictures are taken from a single angle.
- 3D imaging: an imaging technique that pictures are taken from different angles to create a volume of images.
